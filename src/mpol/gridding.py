class Gridder:
    r"""
    The Gridder object uses desired image dimensions (via the ``cell_size`` and ``npix`` arguments) to define a corresponding Fourier plane grid as a :class:`.GridCoords` object. A pre-computed :class:`.GridCoords` can be supplied in lieu of ``cell_size`` and ``npix``, but all three arguments should never be supplied at once. For more details on the properties of the grid that is created, see the :class:`.GridCoords` documentation.

    The :class:`.Gridder` object accepts "loose" *ungridded* visibility data and stores the arrays to the object as instance attributes. The input visibility data should be the set of visibilities over the full :math:`[-u,u]` and :math:`[-v,v]` domain, the Gridder will automatically augment the dataset to include the complex conjugates. The visibilities can be 1d for a single continuum channel, or 2d for image cube. If 1d, visibilities will be converted to 2d arrays of shape ``(1, nvis)``. Like the :class:`~mpol.images.ImageCube` class, after construction, the Gridder assumes that you are operating with a multi-channel set of visibilities. These routines will still work with single-channel 'continuum' visibilities, they will just have nchan = 1 in the first dimension of most products.

    Once the loose visibilities are attached, the user can decide how to 'grid', or average, them to a more compact representation on the Fourier grid using the :func:`~mpol.gridding.Gridder.grid_visibilities` routine.

    If your goal is to use these gridded visibilities in Regularized Maximum Likelihood imaging, you can export them to the appropriate PyTorch object using the :func:`~mpol.gridding.Gridder.to_pytorch_dataset` routine. Note that you must average the visiblities with ``weighting='uniform'``, otherwise the probabilistic interpretation is invalid.

    If you just want to take a quick look at the rough image plane representation of the visibilities, you can view the 'dirty image' and the point spread function or 'dirty beam'. After the visibilities have been gridded with :func:`~mpol.gridding.Gridder.grid_visibilities`, these are available via the :func:`~mpol.gridding.Gridder.get_dirty_image` and :func:`~mpol.gridding.Gridder.get_dirty_beam` methods.

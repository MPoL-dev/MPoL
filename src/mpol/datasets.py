        npix (int): the number of pixels per image side
        coords (GridCoords): an object already instantiated from the GridCoords class. If providing this, cannot provide ``cell_size`` or ``npix``.
        nchan (int): the number of channels in the image (default = 1).
        vis_gridded (torch complex): the gridded visibility data stored in a "packed" format (pre-shifted for fft)
        weight_gridded (torch double): the weights corresponding to the gridded visibility data, also in a packed format
        mask (torch boolean): a boolean mask to index the non-zero locations of ``vis_gridded`` and ``weight_gridded`` in their packed format.
        device (torch.device) : the desired device of the dataset. If ``None``, defalts to current device.


    After initialization, the GriddedDataset provides the non-zero cells of the gridded visibilities and weights as a 1D vector via the following instance variables. This means that any individual channel information has been collapsed.

    :ivar vis_indexed: 1D complex tensor of visibility data
    :ivar weight_indexd: 1D tensor of weight values

    If you index the output of the Fourier layer in the same manner using ``self.mask`` (as done internally within :class:`~mpol.connectors.DataConnector`), then the model and data visibilities can be directly compared using a loss function.

MPoL Installation
=================

MPoL requires ``python >= 3.6``.

Using pip
---------

Stable versions are hosted on PyPI and are installed via ::

    $ pip install MPoL

From source
-----------

If you'd like to install the package from source to access the latest development version, download or ``git clone`` the MPoL repository and install ::

    $ git clone https://github.com/MPoL-dev/MPoL.git
    $ cd MPoL
    $ pip install .

If you have trouble installing please raise a `github issue <https://github.com/MPoL-dev/MPoL/issues>`_ with the particulars of your system.

If you're interested in contributing to the MPoL package, please see the :ref:`developer-documentation-label`.

Upgrading
---------

If you installed from PyPI, to upgrade to the latest stable version of MPoL, do ::

    $ pip install --upgrade MPoL

If you installed from source, update the repository ::

    $ cd MPoL
    $ git pull
    $ pip install .

You can determine your current installed version by ::

    $ python
    >>> import mpol
    >>> print(mpol.__version__)

Using CUDA acceleration
-----------------------
MPoL uses PyTorch for its Neural Networks as seen in the `Optimization Loop` tutorial. If you are interested in using PyTorch's full potential by utilizing a Nvidia graphics card, then the CUDA tool kit will need to be installed (TensorVision is also required). More information on this is available in the `GPU Tutorial` page. It is worth noting that PyTorch may need to be (re)installed separately using a specific `pip` for your system.

More information on this can be found on the PyTorch homepage: `pytorch.org <pytorch.org>`__.
